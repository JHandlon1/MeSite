Last night I didn't sleep a lot. I guess I got roughly 4 hours of sleep. I don't really know why I woke up, but when I looked at my clock, it was 4:30 am. I'm guessing it was a mix of stress or something, but my body told me I had to be up. Now that I'm up however, I could spend a little time studying for a quiz I didn't get a chance to. Hopefully this day will be fun, but my only two classes today both have some form of exam so we'll see. This weekend should be fun, I'm traveling to Virginia Tech to go to a billiards tournament. I'm hoping to do well, but I also need to do a lot of work while I'm there. Only way to figure out how things will go is to wait. For now, I'm just tired.
