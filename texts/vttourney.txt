Howdy y'all. Today I went to a billiards tournament at Virginia Tech. I played for the JMU B team. So far, we've gone through one day of pool, and right now I'm in the loser's bracket semi finals. I'm very tired from my lack of sleep the past few nights, but I'm pushing through. I've played some good and some bad games of pool today but a lot of it has just been waiting. Tomorrow will hopefully be fun since we're gonna run a scotch doubles tournament just like the A team will be. Scotch doubles was what I really wanted to do anyways. So I'm happy, but I'm also so out of it right now.

Update as of 11/19/24:
I'm now back from the tournament. The rest of it was fun, sadly I lost the rest of my games so I only got to play 2 more. All in all I played 4 games (races to 3) at the tournament. I wish it could've been more, but I'm still glad I went. I'm now invigorated to practice more and get on the A team again so I can play more and compete with the best at each school. I really wanna get better, so I'm gonna do my best for next semester.
