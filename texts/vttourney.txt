Howdy y'all. Today I went to a billiards tournament at Virginia Tech. I played for the JMU B team. So far, we've gone through one day of pool, and right now I'm in the loser's bracket semi finals. I'm very tired from my lack of sleep the past few nights, but I'm pushing through. I've played some good and some bad games of pool today but a lot of it has just been waiting. Tomorrow will hopefully be fun since we're gonna run a scotch doubles tournament just like the A team will be. Scotch doubles was what I really wanted to do anyways. So I'm happy, but I'm also so out of it right now.
