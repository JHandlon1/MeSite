Here's a very unorganized intro to me: I'm a Junior CS Major at James Madison University in Harrisonburg Virginia. I love coding in all facets, and this is the first time I've ever used HTML! I'm very logic-oriented, so I love puzzles. I've also played pretty much every board game in existence, and collect some of them. I think I have over 100 back home. I also love the idea of penetraion testing, although I'm not actually skilled enough for that yet haha. Lastly, I love helping others. I'm currently a TA for our CS department and I love every second of it (excpet I think our meetings could be better streamlined). I have a lovely girlfriend of roughly 1 year now! I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
